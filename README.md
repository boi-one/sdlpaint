# SDL PAINT
A small application I made to see how the sdl surface works.  

[DOWNLOAD NOW!!](https://github.com/boi-one/sdlpaint/releases/tag/1.0)

## Install
unzip the files but keep them in the same directory, the executable needs the SDL.dll.

## Controls

[1]           = set color to white  
[2]           = set color to black  
[3]           = set color to red  
[4]           = set color to green  
[5]           = set color to blue  
[6]           = set color to yellow  
[7]           = set color to rainbow (cycles through all of the colors quickly)  
[0]           = resets canvas  
[scroll up]   = increase pen size  
[scroll down] = decrease pen size  
[escape]      = quit application  

## How to Build

1. pull repository
2. install cmake
3. create directory called `build`
4. cd into the build directory
5. type `cmake ..` to build the project
6. open the solution file
   
if there are any problems check the CMakeList.txt, its either the vcpkg.cmake which is located somewhere else or you don't have vcpkg installed at all.
