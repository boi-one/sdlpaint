# SDL PAINT
A small application I made to see how the sdl surface works.

## controls

[1]           = set color to white  
[2]           = set color to black  
[3]           = set color to red  
[4]           = set color to green  
[5]           = set color to blue  
[6]           = set color to yellow  
[7]           = set color to rainbow (cycles through all of the colors quickly)  
[0]           = resets canvas  
[scroll up]   = increase pen size  
[scroll down] = decrease pen size  
[escape]      = quit application
